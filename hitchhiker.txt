Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his
will was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was
because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the
hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the
star system of Orion Beta. The game was not unlike the Earth
game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in
front of each of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as
immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh don't give
me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me
none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my
tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour
me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit").
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on
the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his
opponent - who would then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played
again. And again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because
one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the
final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually
obscenely biological.
